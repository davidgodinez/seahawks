## Project description

We’re working for Memorial university. Our mission is to get people excited to come to Seahawks’ basketball games. To do this, we will take pictures from the Seahawks basketball page and change them to look like paintings. 


## Brainstorm:
- [ ] Initialize a repo seahawks-newsletter-pipeline and clone it to my local machine 
    - [ ] In GitHub initialize a repo
    - [ ] Git set up locally with vscode 
    - [ ] Vscode will be used for debugging from now on 
- [ ] Dockerize the pipeline 
- [ ] Figure out which pictures we’ll use 
- [ ] Figure out how to access the pictures and download 
    - [ ] Use Web-scraping to get pictures
    - [ ] Store the images in a database 
- [ ] Figure out how to transform them
    - [ ] Use datajoint to retrieve and interact with database via ipython 
    - [ ] Transform images inside a Jupyter notebook
